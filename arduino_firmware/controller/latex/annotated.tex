\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structmotor}{motor}} \\*Structure to represent motor parameters for PID feedforward.

This structure is used within the lookup table to map specific motor speed (in ticks per second) to a corresponding PWM signal value and operational mode. It is a key component in implementing feedforward control in PID controllers for motors }{\pageref{structmotor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structvec}{vec}} \\*The struct {\ttfamily vec} represents a 2D vector with {\ttfamily x} and {\ttfamily y} components }{\pageref{structvec}}{}
\end{DoxyCompactList}
