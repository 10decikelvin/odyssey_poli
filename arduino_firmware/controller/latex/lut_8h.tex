\hypertarget{lut_8h}{}\label{lut_8h}\index{lut.h@{lut.h}}


Defines the lookup table for feedforward of PID.

This header file contains the definition of a lookup table (LUT) used for the feedforward component of a PID controller. The LUT provides predefined output values for given input conditions, enhancing the PID controller\textquotesingle{}s response by compensating for known system behaviors in advance.  


\doxysubsubsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
struct \mbox{\hyperlink{structmotor}{motor}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Structure to represent motor parameters for PID feedforward.

This structure is used within the lookup table to map specific motor speed (in ticks per second) to a corresponding PWM signal value and operational mode. It is a key component in implementing feedforward control in PID controllers for motors. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Lookup table array for PID feedforward control.

This array of {\ttfamily motor} structures defines the lookup table for the feedforward component of the PID controller. Each entry maps a specific motor speed to a PWM value and operational mode, allowing for immediate adjustment based on the current speed requirement. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
